# UPDATE:
- 3 June 2018: There is a better way to leverage Linux system with Windows 10! You can install Linux sub-system now!
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is the most popular virtual machine app.
  - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB_5fqiysi4) tutorial video
- [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) is the most popular [debian](https://www.debian.org/)-based Linux distro.
- Install Ubuntu on Windows 8/10 (Ubuntu is free, you don't have to donate a penny when downloading Ubuntu)
  - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKBXLAhNVeQ) tutorial video
- NOTE: if you are not happy with the idea of switching from windows to linux, that's total fine.

# Introduction
This repo is designed for python beginners. There are tons of tutorials on Python out there by genius developers and academics who have far more programming knowledge than me, but this is a small and humble guide from me, for fellows who have no prior experience in Python language and want to make the faith jump. I truly hope this guide can be helpful in some way and make your Python programming journey easier to start. In paralle, this repo is also for myself as a treasure box where I can keep notes for what I have learned and collect invaluable resources from the Python community around the world.

Happy Hacking!

- Go to the offical [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and enter the URL

# Installation

## Binary (recommended for beginners)

- Please go to [Anaconda download page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and select **Python 3.x** version for your operation system.
- After downloading the binary, follow the installer and you should be ready to rock!

## Silent mode (recommended for experienced users):

- Download Miniconda3 installer using `wget` (if `wget` is not available, recommend to install `wget` via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/))
```bash
wget http://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```
- Run Miniconda3 installer
```bash
bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```
- Install Jupyter and other essential packages
```bash
conda install jupyter numpy pandas statsmodels scipy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn beautifulsoup4 requests
```

## Homebrew (my preference):

- Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
- Homebrew Miniconda3
```bash
brew cask install miniconda
echo export "PATH=/usr/local/miniconda3/bin:$PATH" >> $HOME/.bash_profile
```
- Install Jupyter and other essential packages
```bash
conda install jupyter numpy pandas statsmodels scipy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn beautifulsoup4 requests
```
- Install Other packages
```bash
conda install -c damianavila82 rise
```
# Environment

Sooner or later, you might need different versions of Python (e.g., Python2 or Python3). To avoid breaking things, you will probably need to manage multiple Python projects, virtual environments, and environment variables.
