# Anaconda Environment
by Dr Liang Jin

This doc outlines the steps to (properly) create a Python development environment for both Windows and macOS users (If you are using Linux, I assume you are comfortable with terminal and capable to install Anaconda for Linux). To have a consistent setup, a virtual environment is highly recommended thus included in this guide.

## Windows Users:

1. Download Anaconda (Python 3.7 version) from (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

2. Install Anaconda via the graphic installer, using recommended settings.

3. Open Anaconda Prompt

4. Create a new virtual environment by typing: `conda create -n minipy python=3.7`

5. Press `Return` or Type `Y` and `Return` to continue the process

6. Once created, you can now activate the environment: `conda activate minipy`

7. You should see the prompt now turns to be something like this `(minipy) C:>...` Congratulations! You installed Python 3.7 inside our conda virtual environment

8. Now you need to install required packages such as Jupyter by entering: `conda install Jupyter`

9. Install other packages such as NumPy, Pandas, BeautifulSoup using step 8

10. Fire up Jupyter Notebook by typing: `jupyter notebook`

11. Note: remember to activate this virtual environment before lauching Jupyter Notebook (step 6), or you will get a "command does not exist" error.

## macOS Users:

1. Open terminal from Launchpad and then other

2. Type in the following command: 

```/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"```

3. Press `Enter` and passwords to continue

4. Once it finishes the installation, then type: `brew cask install miniconda`


5. After installation, type in the following command:
```echo ". /usr/local/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" >> ~/.bash_profile```

6. Now you can use conda

7. Create a new virtual environment by typing: `conda create -n minipy python=3.7`

8. Press `Return` or Type `Y` and `Return` to continue the process

9. Once created, you can now activate the environment: `conda activate minipy`

10. You should see the prompt now turns to be something like this `(minipy) ..:.username$` Congratulations! You installed Python 3.7 inside our conda virtual environment

11. Now you need to install required packages such as Jupyter by entering: `conda install Jupyter`

12. Install other packages such as NumPy, Pandas, BeautifulSoup using step 11

13. Fire up Jupyter Notebook by typing: `jupyter notebook`

14. Note: remember to activate this virtual environment before lauching Jupyter Notebook (Step 9), or you will get a "command does not exist" error.
