    "items = \"\\n\\xa0\\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\\n\\xa0\\nThe risks and uncertainties described below\\nare those specific to the Company which we currently believe have the potential to be material, but they may not be the only ones\\nwe face. If any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that we have not yet identified or that we currently\\nconsider not to be material, actually occur or become material risks, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of\\noperations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Investors are advised to consider these factors along with\\nthe other information included in this Annual Report and to review any additional risks discussed in our filings with the SEC.\\n\\xa0\\nRisks Associated with Our Business\\n\\xa0\\nWe are a newly formed company with no operating history and, accordingly, you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business\\nobjective.\\n\\xa0\\nSince we lack an operating history, you have\\nno basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective, which is to complete our initial Business Combination\\nwith one or more target businesses. We have no plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective target business concerning\\na Business Combination and may be unable to complete our Business Combination. If we fail to complete our Business Combination,\\nwe will never generate any operating revenues.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we are unable to consummate our initial\\nBusiness Combination, our public stockholders may be forced to wait more than 24 months before receiving distributions from the\\nTrust Account.\\n\\xa0\\nWe will have until 18 months from the closing\\nof our Offering (or 24 months from the closing of our Offering if we have executed a letter of intent or definitive agreement for\\nan initial Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of our Offering but have not completed the initial Business Combination\\nwithin such 18-month period) to consummate our initial Business Combination. We have no obligation to return funds to investors\\nprior to such date unless we consummate our initial Business Combination prior thereto and only then in cases where investors have\\nsought to convert their shares. Only after the expiration of this full time period will holders of our common stock be entitled\\nto distributions from the Trust Account if we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination. Accordingly, investors’\\nfunds may be unavailable to them until after such date and to liquidate your investment, public security holders may be forced\\nto sell their public shares, potentially at a loss.\\n\\xa0\\nYou will not be entitled to protections\\nnormally afforded to investors of blank check companies.\\n\\xa0\\nSince the net proceeds of our Offering are\\nintended to be used to complete our initial Business Combination with a target business that has not been identified, we may be\\ndeemed to be a “blank check” company under the United States securities laws. However, since we have net tangible assets\\nin excess of $5,000,001 and have filed a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact,\\nwe are exempt from Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules which would,\\nfor example, completely restrict the transferability of our securities, require us to complete our initial Business Combination\\nwithin 18 months of the effective date of the initial registration statement and restrict the use of interest earned on the funds\\nheld in the Trust Account. Because we are not subject to Rule 419, our Units became immediately tradable, we are entitled to withdraw\\ncertain amounts from the funds held in the Trust Account prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination and we have\\na longer period of time to complete such a Business Combination than we would if we were subject to Rule 419.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa010\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf we determine to change our acquisition\\ncriteria or guidelines, many of the disclosures contained in this Annual Report regarding our acquisition criteria or guidelines\\nwould no longer apply.\\n\\xa0\\nWe could seek to deviate from the acquisition\\ncriteria or guidelines disclosed in this Annual Report although we have no current intention to do so. For instance, as required\\nby Nasdaq, we currently anticipate structuring a Business Combination with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair\\nmarket value that is at least equal to 80% of the value of the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriter’s fees and\\ntaxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the execution of a letter of intent or definitive agreement\\nfor a Business Combination. However, we could be delisted from Nasdaq and therefore no longer be required to meet this requirement.\\nFurthermore, there are numerous agreements between us and our affiliates that could be amended between the parties without approval\\nof public stockholders. In such event, many of the acquisition criteria and guidelines set forth in this Annual Report (such as\\nthe voting, transfer and liquidation restrictions agreed to by the holders of the Insider Shares described in the prospectus associated\\nwith our initial public offering, the indemnification obligations of Kingsway and FMG described below and the obligations of Kingsway\\nand FMG to pay the cost of liquidation if the funds held outside the Trust Account are insufficient for such purposes) may no longer\\napply.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we deviate from the acquisition criteria\\nor guidelines set forth in this Annual Report, holders of our securities may have rescission rights or may bring an action for\\ndamages against us or we could be subject to civil or criminal actions taken by governmental authorities.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we were to elect to deviate from the acquisition\\ncriteria or guidelines set forth in this Annual Report or in the prospectus associated with our initial public offering, each person\\nwho purchased Units in our Offering and still held such securities upon learning of the facts relating to the deviation may seek\\nrescission of the purchase of the Units he or she acquired in the offering (under which a successful claimant has the right to\\nreceive the total amount paid for his or her securities, plus interest and less any income earned on the securities, in exchange\\nfor surrender of the securities) or bring an action for damages against us (compensation for loss on an investment caused by alleged\\nmaterial misrepresentations or omissions in the sale of a security). In such event, we could also be subject to civil or criminal\\nactions taken by governmental authorities. For instance, the SEC can seek injunctions under Section 20(b) of the Securities Act\\nif it believes a violation under the Securities Act has occurred or is imminent. The SEC can also seek civil penalties under Sections\\n20(d) and 24 if a party has violated the Securities Act or an injunctive action taken by the SEC or if a party willfully, in a\\nregistration statement filed under the Securities Act, makes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material\\nfact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Furthermore, Section 20 allows the\\nSEC to refer matters to the attorney general to bring criminal penalties against an issuer.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa011\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe may issue shares of our capital stock\\nto complete our initial Business Combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and likely cause a change\\nin control of our ownership.\\n\\xa0\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation\\ncurrently authorizes the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares\\nof preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. We may issue a substantial number of additional shares of common stock or shares\\nof preferred stock, or a combination of common stock and preferred stock, to complete our initial Business Combination. The issuance\\nof additional shares of common stock or preferred stock:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nMay significantly reduce the equity interest of investors in our securities;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nmay subordinate the rights of holders of shares of common stock if we issue shares of preferred stock with rights senior to those afforded to our shares of common stock;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nmay cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nmay adversely affect prevailing market prices for our shares of common stock.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWe may issue notes or other debt securities,\\nor otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a Business Combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial\\ncondition and thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders’ investment in us.\\n\\xa0\\nWe may choose to incur substantial debt to\\ncomplete our Business Combination. However, the incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\ndefault and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after our initial Business Combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nacceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nour immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nour inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding; and\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nlimitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe funds held in the Trust Account may\\nnot earn significant interest and, as a result, we may be limited to the funds held outside of the Trust Account to fund our search\\nfor target businesses, to pay our tax obligations and to complete our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe depend on sufficient interest being earned\\non the proceeds held in the Trust Account to provide us with additional working capital we may need to identify one or more target\\nbusinesses and to complete our initial Business Combination, as well as to pay any tax obligations that we may owe. Interest rates\\non permissible investments for us have been less than 1% over the last several years. Accordingly, if we do not earn a sufficient\\namount of interest on the funds held in the Trust Account and use all of the funds held outside of the Trust Account, we may not\\nhave sufficient funds available with which to structure, negotiate or close our initial Business Combination. In such event, we\\nwould need to borrow funds from our insiders, officers or directors to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Our insiders, officers\\nand directors are under no obligation to loan us any funds. If we are unable to obtain the funds necessary, we may be forced to\\ncease searching for a target business and may be unable to complete our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa012\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe may not have sufficient working capital\\nto cover our operating expenses.\\n\\xa0\\nFollowing the consummation of the Offering\\nand after paying offering related expenses, the amounts available to us to pay our operating expenses have consisted primarily\\nof the approximately $575,000 initially held outside of the Trust Account and any interest earned on the funds in the Trust Account\\nremaining after interest is released to pay our income or other tax obligations. Additionally, we may delay payment of the $10,000\\nmonthly fee payable to 1347 Capital LLC upon a determination by our audit committee that we lack sufficient funds held outside\\nthe trust to pay actual or anticipated expenses in connection with our initial business combination, with any such unpaid amount\\naccruing without interest and becoming due and payable no later than the date of the consummation of our initial business combination.\\nHowever, the amounts available to us, even if we cease paying the $10,000 monthly fee to 1347 Capital LLC, may not be sufficient\\nto fund our operating expenses. In such event, we would need to borrow funds from our insiders, officers or directors or from third\\nparties to continue to operate. However, our insiders, officers and directors and third parties are under no obligation to loan\\nus any funds. If we are unable to obtain the necessary funds, we may be forced to cease searching for a target business and liquidate\\nwithout completing our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nReimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses\\nincurred by our insiders, officers, directors or any of their affiliates in connection with certain activities on our behalf, such\\nas identifying and investigating possible business targets for a Business Combination, could reduce the funds available to us to\\nconsummate a Business Combination. In addition, an indemnification claim by one or more of our officers and directors in the event\\nthat any of them are sued in their capacity as an officer or director could also reduce the funds available to us outside of the\\nTrust Account.\\n\\xa0\\nWe reimburse our insiders, officers, directors\\nor any of their affiliates for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with certain activities on our behalf, such as identifying\\nand investigating possible business targets for a Business Combination. There is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses\\nreimbursable by us; provided, that, to the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the Trust Account\\nand the interest income earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account that may be released to us, such expenses would not be\\nreimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial Business Combination. In addition, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate\\nof incorporation and Delaware law, we may be required to indemnify our officers and directors in the event that any of them are\\nsued in their capacity as an officer or director. We have also entered into agreements with our officers and directors to provide\\ncontractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation\\nand under Delaware law. In the event that we reimburse our insiders, officers, directors or any of their affiliates for out-of-pocket\\nexpenses prior to the consummation of a Business Combination or are required to indemnify any of our officers or directors pursuant\\nto our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, Delaware law, or the indemnity agreements that we have entered into with\\nthem, we would use funds available to us outside of the Trust Account or interest released to us from the Trust Account for our\\nworking capital requirements. Any reduction in the funds available to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to\\nlocate and investigate prospective target businesses and to structure, negotiate, conduct due diligence in connection with or consummate\\nour initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa013\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf third parties bring claims against\\nus, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per-share redemption price received by stockholders may be\\nless than approximately $10.00.\\n\\xa0\\nOur placing of funds in the Trust Account may\\nnot protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors and service providers we\\nengage and prospective target businesses we negotiate with execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim\\nof any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public stockholders, they may not execute such\\nagreements. Furthermore, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they may seek recourse against the Trust Account.\\nA court may not uphold the validity of such agreements. Accordingly, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to\\nclaims which could take priority over those of our public stockholders. If we are unable to complete an initial Business Combination\\nwithin the required time period, Kingsway and FMG have agreed that they will be jointly and severally liable to ensure that the\\nproceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are\\nowed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but only if such a vendor or prospective target\\nbusiness does not execute such a waiver. However, Kingsway and FMG may not be able to meet such obligation as we have not required\\nKingsway and FMG to retain any assets to provide for their indemnification obligations, nor have we taken any further steps to\\nensure that Kingsway and FMG will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that arise. Moreover, Kingsway and FMG will\\nnot be liable to our public stockholders if they should fail to satisfy their obligations under this agreement and instead will\\nonly be liable to us. Therefore, the per share redemption or conversion amount received by public stockholders may be less than\\napproximately $10.00 due to such claims.\\n\\xa0\\nAdditionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy\\ncase or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could\\nbe subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties\\nwith priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, the per share\\nredemption or conversion amount received by public stockholders may be less than $10.00.\\n\\xa0\\nOur stockholders may be held liable for\\nclaims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we have not completed our initial Business\\nCombination within 18 months from the closing of our Offering (or 24 months from the closing of our Offering if we have entered\\ninto a letter of intent or definitive agreement with a target business for a Business Combination within 18 months from the closing\\nof our Offering but the Business Combination has not been consummated within such 18-month period), we will (i) cease all operations\\nexcept for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem\\n100% of the outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account which redemption will completely\\nextinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions,\\nif any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval\\nof our remaining holders of common stock and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii)\\nabove) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. We\\nmay not properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable\\nfor any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well\\nbeyond the third anniversary of the date of distribution. Accordingly, third parties may seek to recover from our stockholders\\namounts owed to them by us.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa014\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds\\nin the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against\\nus that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be\\nviewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us\\nto claims of punitive damages.\\n\\xa0\\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the\\nTrust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against\\nus that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy\\nlaws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court\\ncould seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached\\nits fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages,\\nby paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.\\n\\xa0\\nIf, before distributing the proceeds\\nin the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against\\nus that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our stockholders and\\nthe per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\\n\\xa0\\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the\\nTrust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against\\nus that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included\\nin our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent\\nany bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection\\nwith our liquidation may be reduced.\\n\\xa0\\nUnlike other blank check companies, our\\nUnits are comprised of common stock, warrants to purchase one-half of one share of our common stock and rights, rather than units\\ncomprised of common stock and warrants to purchase one share of our common stock.\\n\\xa0\\nUnlike other blank check companies that sell\\nunits comprised of shares of common stock and warrants to purchase one share of our common stock in their initial public offerings,\\nwe issued Units comprised of shares of common stock, warrants to purchase one-half of one share of our common stock and rights\\nautomatically entitling the holder to receive one-tenth of a share of common stock upon consummation of our initial Business Combination.\\nNeither the rights nor the warrants will have any voting rights and each will expire and be worthless if we do not consummate an\\ninitial Business Combination. Furthermore, no fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. As a result, unless\\nyou acquire at least two warrants, you will not be able to receive a share of common stock upon exercise of your warrants. Accordingly,\\ninvestors in our Offering were not issued as many shares as part of their investment as they may have in other blank check company\\nofferings, which may have the effect of limiting the potential upside value of your investment in our company.\\n\\xa0\\nHolders of rights and warrants will not\\nhave redemption rights if we are unable to complete an initial Business Combination within the required time period.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we are unable to complete an initial Business\\nCombination within the required time period and we redeem our outstanding public shares using the funds held in the Trust Account,\\nthe rights and warrants will expire and holders thereof will not receive any of such proceeds with respect to such rights and warrants,\\nrespectively.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa015\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe requirement that our initial Business\\nCombination occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of\\nthe Trust Account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial Business Combination may limit the type\\nand number of companies that we may complete such a Business Combination with.\\n\\xa0\\nPursuant to the Nasdaq listing rules, our initial\\nBusiness Combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80%\\nof the value of the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriter’s fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the\\nTrust Account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial Business Combination. This restriction may\\nlimit the type and number of companies that we may complete a Business Combination with. If we are unable to locate a target business\\nor businesses that satisfy this fair market value test, we may be forced to liquidate and you will only be entitled to receive\\nyour pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account.\\n\\xa0\\nOur management may not be able to maintain\\ncontrol of a target business after our initial Business Combination. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of\\na target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business.\\n\\xa0\\nWe may structure our initial Business Combination\\nsuch that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order\\nto meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Business\\nCombination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or\\notherwise owns or acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment\\ncompany under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities\\nof the target, our stockholders prior to the Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction\\ncompany, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue\\na transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target.\\nIn this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial\\nnumber of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of\\nour outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. In addition, other minority stockholders may subsequently\\ncombine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company’s stock than we initially\\nacquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control of the target\\nbusiness.\\n\\xa0\\nOur ability to successfully effect our\\ninitial Business Combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some\\nof whom may join us following our initial Business Combination. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage\\nafter our initial Business Combination, our assessment of these individuals may not prove to be correct.\\n\\xa0\\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial\\nBusiness Combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. We believe that our success depends on the continued service\\nof our key personnel, at least until we have consummated our initial Business Combination. None of our officers are required to\\ncommit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, they will have conflicts of interest in allocating management\\ntime among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.\\nIf our officers’ and directors’ other business affairs require them to devote more substantial amounts of time to their\\nother business activities, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs and could have a negative impact on our ability\\nto consummate our initial Business Combination. In addition, we do not have employment agreements with, or key-man insurance on\\nthe life of, any of our officers. The unexpected loss of the services of our key personnel could have a detrimental effect on us.\\nThe role of our key personnel after our initial Business Combination, however, remains to be determined. Although some of our key\\npersonnel serve in senior management or advisory positions following our initial Business Combination, it is likely that most,\\nif not all, of the management of the target business will remain in place. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements\\nof operating a public company which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such\\nrequirements. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect\\nour operations.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa016\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nOur officers and directors may not have\\nsignificant experience or knowledge regarding the jurisdiction or industry of the target business we may seek to consummate our\\ninitial Business Combination with.\\n\\xa0\\nWe may consummate a business combination with\\na target business in any geographic location or industry we choose. Our officers and directors may not have enough experience or\\nsufficient knowledge relating to the jurisdiction of the target or its industry to make an informed decision regarding our initial\\nBusiness Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nOur key personnel may negotiate employment\\nor consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular Business Combination. These agreements may provide\\nfor them to receive compensation following our initial Business Combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of\\ninterest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.\\n\\xa0\\nOur key personnel may be able to remain with\\nthe company after the completion of our Business Combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements\\nin connection with the Business Combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the Business\\nCombination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for\\nservices they would render to us after the completion of the Business Combination. The personal and financial interests of such\\nindividuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business.\\n\\xa0\\nMembers of our management team may have\\naffiliations with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and accordingly, may\\nhave conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\\n\\xa0\\nMembers of our management team may have affiliations\\nwith companies, including companies that are engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us. Accordingly,\\nthey may participate in transactions and have obligations that may be in conflict or competition with our consummation of our initial\\nBusiness Combination. As a result, a potential target business may be presented by our management team to another entity prior\\nto its presentation to us and we may not be afforded the opportunity to engage in a transaction with such target business.\\n\\xa0\\nWe may engage in a Business Combination\\nwith one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our executive officers, directors\\nor insiders, which may raise potential conflicts of interest.\\n\\xa0\\nIn light of the involvement of our insiders,\\nofficers, and directors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our insiders, officers,\\nand directors. Our directors and officers also serve as officers and board members for other entities. Although we will not be\\nspecifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we\\ndetermined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for a Business Combination, such transaction was approved by a majority\\nof our disinterested and independent directors (if we have any at that time), and we obtain an opinion from an independent investment\\nbanking firm that the Business Combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view. Despite our\\nagreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm regarding the fairness to our company from a financial\\npoint of view of a Business Combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our officers, directors\\nor insiders, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the Business Combination may not be\\nas advantageous to our public stockholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa017\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe shares beneficially owned by our\\ninsiders, officers and directors will not participate in a redemption and, therefore, our insiders, officers and directors may\\nhave a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nOur insiders, officers and directors have waived\\ntheir right to convert their Insider Shares, Private Units, $15 Exercise Price Sponsor Warrants, or to redemption rights with respect\\nto their Insider Shares, Private Units or $15 Exercise Price Sponsor Warrants upon a redemption if we are unable to consummate\\nour initial Business Combination. Accordingly, these securities will be worthless if we do not consummate our initial Business\\nCombination. Any rights and warrants they hold, like those held by the public, will also be worthless if we do not consummate an\\ninitial Business Combination. The personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation\\nin timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a Business Combination. Consequently, our directors’\\nand officers’ discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when\\ndetermining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular Business Combination are appropriate and in our stockholders’\\nbest interest.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we are unable to consummate a Business\\nCombination, any loans made by our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates would not be repaid, resulting in a potential\\nconflict of interest in determining whether a potential transaction is in our stockholders’ best interest.\\n\\xa0\\nIn order to meet our working capital needs\\nour insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any\\ntime, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. The loans would be non-interest bearing and would be payable\\nat the consummation of a Business Combination. If we fail to consummate a Business Combination within the required time period,\\nthe loans would not be repaid. Consequently, our directors and officers may have a conflict of interest in determining whether\\nthe terms, conditions and timing of a particular Business Combination are appropriate and in our stockholders’ best interest.\\n\\xa0\\nNasdaq may delist our securities from\\nquotation on its exchange which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional\\ntrading restrictions.\\n\\xa0\\nOur securities are currently listed on Nasdaq.\\nWe currently do not meet the 300 public holders requirement for Nasdaq listing, but have been granted approval by Nasdaq to show\\ncompliance with this rule by July 7, 2016. Although we expect to meet the listing standards of Nasdaq, we cannot assure you that\\nour securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq in the future or prior to our initial Business Combination. In order to continue\\nlisting our securities on Nasdaq prior to our initial Business Combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and\\nstock price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum amount in stockholders’ equity (generally $2,500,000) and a minimum\\nnumber of holders of our securities (generally 300 public holders). We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to meet\\nthose Nasdaq’s listing requirements.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa018\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf Nasdaq delists our securities from trading\\non its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nreduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\na determination that our shares are a “penny stock,” which will require brokers trading in our shares to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWe may only be able to complete one Business\\nCombination with the proceeds of our Offering, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a\\nlimited number of products or services.\\n\\xa0\\nIt is likely we will consummate our initial\\nBusiness Combination with a single target business, although we have the ability to simultaneously consummate our initial Business\\nCombination with several target businesses. By consummating a Business Combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification\\nmay subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations\\nor benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to\\ncomplete several Business Combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects\\nfor our success may be:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nsolely dependent upon the performance of a single business, or\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\ndependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThis lack of diversification may subject us\\nto numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the\\nparticular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nAlternatively, if we determine to simultaneously\\nconsummate our initial Business Combination with several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will\\nneed for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other\\nBusiness Combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the Business Combination. With\\nmultiple Business Combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible\\nmultiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with\\nthe subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the target companies in a single operating business.\\nIf we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa019\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe ability of our public stockholders\\nto exercise their conversion rights may not allow us to effectuate the most desirable Business Combination or optimize our capital\\nstructure.\\n\\xa0\\nIf our initial Business Combination requires\\nus to use substantially all of our cash to pay the purchase price, because we will not know how many public stockholders may exercise\\nconversion rights, we may either need to reserve part of the Trust Account for possible payment upon such conversion, or we may\\nneed to arrange third party financing to help fund our initial Business Combination. In the event that the Business Combination\\ninvolves the issuance of our stock as consideration, we may be required to issue a higher percentage of our stock to make up for\\na shortfall in funds. Raising additional funds to cover any shortfall may involve dilutive equity financing or incurring indebtedness\\nat higher than desirable levels. This may limit our ability to effectuate the most attractive Business Combination available to\\nus.\\n\\xa0\\nWe may be unable to consummate an initial\\nBusiness Combination if a target business requires that we have a certain amount of cash at closing, in which case public stockholders\\nmay have to remain stockholders of our company and wait until our redemption of the public shares to receive a pro rata share of\\nthe Trust Account or attempt to sell their shares in the open market.\\n\\xa0\\nA potential target may make it a closing condition\\nto our initial Business Combination that we have a certain amount of cash in excess of the $5,000,001 of net tangible assets we\\nare required to have pursuant to our organizational documents available at the time of closing. If the number of our public stockholders\\nelecting to exercise their conversion rights has the effect of reducing the amount of money available to us to consummate an initial\\nBusiness Combination below such minimum amount required by the target business and we are not able to locate an alternative source\\nof funding, we will not be able to consummate such initial Business Combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable\\ntarget within the applicable time period, if at all. In that case, public stockholders may have to remain stockholders of our company\\nand wait the full 24 months in order to be able to receive a portion of the Trust Account, or attempt to sell their shares in the\\nopen market prior to such time, in which case they may receive less than they would have in a liquidation of the Trust Account.\\n\\xa0\\nWe will offer each public stockholder\\nthe option to vote in favor of the proposed Business Combination and still seek conversion of his, her or its shares.\\n\\xa0\\nIn connection with any meeting held to approve\\nan initial Business Combination, we will offer each public stockholder (but not our sponsors, officers or directors) the right\\nto have his, her or its shares of common stock converted to cash regardless of whether such stockholder votes for or against such\\nproposed Business Combination; provided that a stockholder must in fact vote for or against a proposed Business Combination in\\norder to have his, her or its shares of common stock converted to cash. If a stockholder fails to vote for or against a proposed\\nBusiness Combination, that stockholder would not be able to have his shares of common stock so converted. We will consummate our\\ninitial Business Combination only if public stockholders do not exercise conversion rights in an amount that would cause our net\\ntangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of\\nthe Business Combination. Accordingly, public stockholders owning 4,099,999 shares of common stock sold in our Offering may exercise\\ntheir conversion rights and we could still consummate a proposed Business Combination so long as a majority of shares voted at\\nthe meeting are voted in favor of the proposed Business Combination. This is different than other similarly structured blank check\\ncompanies where stockholders are offered the right to convert their shares only when they vote against a proposed Business Combination.\\nThis threshold and the ability to seek conversion while voting in favor of a proposed Business Combination may make it more likely\\nthat we will consummate our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa020\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nA public stockholder that fails to vote\\neither in favor of or against a proposed Business Combination will not be able to have his or her shares converted to cash.\\n\\xa0\\nIn order for a public stockholder to have his\\nor her shares converted to cash in connection with any proposed Business Combination, that public stockholder must vote either\\nin favor of or against a proposed Business Combination. If a public stockholder fails to vote in favor of or against a proposed\\nBusiness Combination, whether that stockholder abstains from the vote or simply does not vote, that stockholder would not be able\\nto have his or her shares of common stock so converted to cash in connection with such Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nPublic stockholders, together with any\\naffiliates of theirs or any other person with whom they are acting in concert or as a “group,” will be restricted from\\nseeking conversion rights with respect to more than 20% of the shares of common stock sold in our Offering.\\n\\xa0\\nIn connection with any meeting held to approve\\nan initial Business Combination, we will offer each public stockholder (but not our insiders, officers or directors) the right\\nto have his, her, or its shares of common stock converted into cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public stockholder, together\\nwith any affiliate of his or hers, or any other person with whom he or she is acting in concert or as a “group” will\\nbe restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to more than 20% of the shares of common stock sold in our Offering.\\nGenerally, in this context, a stockholder will be deemed to be acting in concert or as a group with another stockholder when such\\nstockholders agree to act together for the purpose of acquiring, voting, holding or disposing of our equity securities. Accordingly,\\nif you purchase more than 20% of the shares of common stock sold in our Offering and our proposed Business Combination is approved,\\nyou will not be able to seek conversion rights with respect to the full amount of your shares and may be forced to hold such additional\\nshares of common stock or sell them in the open market. The value of such additional shares may not appreciate over time following\\nour initial Business Combination, and the market price of our shares of common stock may not exceed the per-share conversion price.\\n\\xa0\\nWe may require public stockholders who\\nwish to convert their shares of common stock in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements\\nfor conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising\\ntheir rights.\\n\\xa0\\nIn connection with any stockholder meeting\\ncalled to approve a proposed initial Business Combination, each public stockholder will have the right, regardless of whether he\\nor she is voting for or against such proposed Business Combination, to demand that we convert his or her shares of common stock\\ninto a share of the Trust Account. We may require public stockholders seeking to convert their shares, whether they are a record\\nholder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent or to deliver\\ntheir shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian)\\nSystem, at the holder’s option, at least two business days prior to the vote on the initial Business Combination. In order\\nto obtain a physical stock certificate, a stockholder’s broker and/or clearing broker, DTC and our transfer agent will need\\nto act to facilitate this request. It is our understanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain\\nphysical certificates from the transfer agent. However, because we do not have any control over this process or over the brokers\\nor DTC, it may take significantly longer than two weeks to obtain a physical stock certificate. While we have been advised that\\nit takes a short time to deliver shares through the DWAC System, this may not be the case. Under Delaware law and our bylaws, we\\nare required to provide at least 10 days advance notice of any stockholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a\\npublic stockholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. Accordingly, if it takes longer than we anticipate\\nfor stockholders to deliver their shares, stockholders who wish to convert may be unable to meet the deadline for exercising their\\nconversion rights and thus may be unable to convert their shares.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa021\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf we require public stockholders who wish to convert their\\nshares of common stock to comply with the delivery requirements discussed above for conversion, such converting stockholders may\\nbe unable to sell their securities when they wish to in the event that the proposed Business Combination is not approved.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we require public stockholders who wish\\nto convert their shares of common stock to comply with the delivery requirements discussed above for conversion and such proposed\\nBusiness Combination is not consummated, we will promptly return such certificates to the tendering public stockholders. Accordingly,\\ninvestors who attempted to convert their shares in such a circumstance will be unable to sell their securities after the failed\\nBusiness Combination until we have returned their securities to them. The market price for our shares of common stock may decline\\nduring this time and you may not be able to sell your securities when you wish to, even while other stockholders that did not seek\\nconversion may be able to sell their securities.\\n\\xa0\\nBecause of our structure, other companies\\nmay have a competitive advantage and we may not be able to consummate an attractive Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nWe expect to encounter intense competition\\nfrom entities other than blank check companies having a business objective similar to ours, including venture capital funds, leveraged\\nbuyout funds and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive\\nexperience in identifying and effecting Business Combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess\\ngreater technical, human and other resources than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted\\nwith those of many of these competitors. Therefore, our ability to compete in consummating our initial Business Combination with\\ncertain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives\\nothers an advantage in pursuing a Business Combination with certain target businesses. Furthermore, seeking stockholder approval\\nof our initial Business Combination may delay the consummation of a transaction. Additionally, our rights and warrants, and the\\nfuture dilution they represent (entitling the holders to receive shares of our common stock on exercise of the warrants or, with\\nrespect to the rights, on consummation of our initial Business Combination), may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses.\\nAny of the foregoing may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nOur ability to consummate an attractive\\nBusiness Combination may be impacted by the market for initial public offerings.\\n\\xa0\\nIf the market for initial public offerings\\nis limited, we believe there will be a greater number of attractive target businesses open to consummating an initial Business\\nCombination with us as a means to achieve publicly held status. Alternatively, if the market for initial public offerings is robust,\\nwe believe that there will be fewer attractive target businesses amenable to consummating an initial Business Combination with\\nus to become a public reporting company. Accordingly, during periods with strong public offering markets, it may be more difficult\\nfor us to complete an initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nWe may be unable to obtain additional\\nfinancing, if required, to complete our initial Business Combination or to fund the operations and growth of the target business,\\nwhich could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination.\\n\\xa0\\nIf the net proceeds of our Offering prove to\\nbe insufficient, either because of the size of the Business Combination, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search\\nof a target business, or the obligation to convert into cash a significant number of shares of common stock, we will be required\\nto seek additional financing. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional\\nfinancing proves to be unavailable when needed to consummate a particular Business Combination, we would be compelled to either\\nrestructure the transaction or abandon that particular Business Combination and seek an alternative target business candidate.\\nIn addition, if we consummate a Business Combination, we may require additional financing to fund the operations or growth of the\\ntarget business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or\\ngrowth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection\\nwith or after our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa022\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nOur insiders, officers and directors,\\nwill control a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a stockholder vote.\\n\\xa0\\nOur insiders, officers and directors, collectively\\nown 22.7% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. None of our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates has\\nindicated to us any intention to purchase shares from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, our insiders,\\nofficers, directors or their affiliates could determine in the future to make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions,\\nto the extent permitted by law, in order to influence the vote. In connection with any vote for a proposed Business Combination,\\nour insiders, officers and directors have agreed to vote the shares of common stock owned by them immediately before our Offering\\nas well as the private shares and any shares of common stock acquired in our Offering or in the aftermarket in favor of such proposed\\nBusiness Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nIf our security holders exercise their\\nregistration rights, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares of common stock and the existence of these\\nrights may make it more difficult to effect our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nOur insiders are entitled to make a demand\\nthat we register the resale of the Insider Shares at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which their shares may\\nbe released from escrow. Additionally, the purchasers of the Private Units and $15 Exercise Price Sponsor Warrants and our insiders,\\nofficers, directors or their affiliates are entitled to demand that we register the resale of the Private Units and $15 Exercise\\nPrice Sponsor Warrants (and underlying securities of each) and any shares our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates\\nmay be issued in payment of working capital loans made to us commencing on the date that we consummate our initial Business Combination.\\nThe presence of these additional shares of common stock trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price\\nof our securities. In addition, the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effectuate our initial Business Combination\\nor increase the cost of consummating our initial Business Combination with the target business, as the stockholders of the target\\nbusiness may be discouraged from entering into a Business Combination with us or will request a higher price for their securities\\nbecause of the potential effect the exercise of such rights may have on the trading market for our shares of common stock.\\n\\xa0\\nEarlyBirdCapital may have a conflict\\nof interest in rendering services to us as our non-exclusive investment banker in connection with our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nWe have engaged EarlyBirdCapital as an investment\\nbanker to assist us with our initial Business Combination. We will pay EarlyBirdCapital a cash fee for such services upon the consummation\\nof our initial Business Combination in an amount equal to 3.5% of the total gross proceeds raised in the Offering, less up to 30%\\nof such fee that we may allocate to one or more other advisors that assist us in identifying or consummating an initial Business\\nCombination (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might become payable). Additionally, EarlyBirdCapital was issued\\nunit purchase options in connection with our Offering. These financial interests may result in EarlyBirdCapital having a conflict\\nof interest when providing the services to us as our investment banker in connection with an initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa023\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf we are deemed to be an investment\\ncompany, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make\\nit difficult for us to complete our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company\\nunder the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nrestrictions on the nature of our investments; and\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nrestrictions on the issuance of securities, each of which may make it difficult for us to complete our Business Combination. \\n\\n\\xa0\\nIn addition, we may have imposed upon us certain\\nburdensome requirements, including:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nregistration as an investment company;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nadoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nreporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIn order not to be regulated as an investment\\ncompany under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily\\nin a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading in securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting,\\nowning, holding or trading “investment securities” constituting more than 40% of our total assets (exclusive of U.S.\\ngovernment securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business will be to identify and complete a Business Combination\\nand thereafter to operate the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets\\nwith a view to resale or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor.\\n\\xa0\\nWe do not believe that our anticipated principal\\nactivities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the Trust Account may only be invested\\nin United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having\\na maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment\\nCompany Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not\\npermitted to invest in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having\\na business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in\\nthe manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an “investment company” within\\nthe meaning of the Investment Company Act.. The Trust Account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earlier to occur\\nof either: (i) the completion of our primary business objective, which is a Business Combination; or (ii) absent a Business Combination,\\nour return of the funds held in the Trust Account to our public stockholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. If\\nwe do not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed\\nto be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses\\nfor which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete a Business Combination. If we are unable to complete\\nour initial Business Combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of\\nour Trust Account and our public rights and public warrants will expire worthless.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa024\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe requirement that we complete our\\ninitial Business Combination within 18 or 24 months from the closing of our Offering may give potential target businesses leverage\\nover us in negotiating our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nWe have 18 months from the closing of our offering\\n(or 24 months from the closing of our offering if we have executed a letter of intent or definitive agreement for an initial Business\\nCombination within 18 months from the closing of our Offering but have not completed the Business Combination within such 18-month\\nperiod) to complete our initial Business Combination. Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning\\na Business Combination will be aware of this requirement. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating\\na Business Combination, knowing that if we do not complete a Business Combination with that particular target business, we may\\nbe unable to complete a Business Combination with any other target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the time\\nlimit referenced above.\\n\\xa0\\nWe may not obtain a fairness opinion\\nwith respect to the target business that we seek to consummate our initial Business Combination with and therefore you may be relying\\nsolely on the judgment of our board of directors in approving a proposed Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nWe will only be required to obtain a fairness\\nopinion with respect to the target business that we seek to consummate our initial Business Combination with if it is an entity\\nthat is affiliated with any of our insiders, officers or directors. In all other instances, we will have no obligation to obtain\\nan opinion. Accordingly, investors may be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors in approving a proposed Business\\nCombination.\\n\\xa0\\nWe are not required to obtain an opinion\\nfrom an independent investment banking or accounting firm, and consequently, you may have no assurance from an independent source\\nthat the price we are paying for the business is fair to our company from a financial point of view.\\n\\xa0\\nUnless we complete our Business Combination\\nwith an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking or accounting firm that\\nthe price we are paying is fair to our company from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our stockholders will\\nbe relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted\\nby the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials,\\nas applicable, related to our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nResources could be wasted in researching\\nbusiness combinations that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire\\nor merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination, our public stockholders may receive\\nonly approximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our public rights and public warrants will expire\\nworthless.\\n\\xa0\\nWe anticipate that the investigation of each\\nspecific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments\\nwill require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide\\nnot to complete a specific initial Business Combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely\\nwould not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete\\nour initial Business Combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a\\nloss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge\\nwith another business. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination, our public stockholders may receive only\\napproximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our public rights and public warrants will expire worthless.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa025\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\\nof 2002 will require substantial financial and management resources and may increase the time and costs of completing an initial\\nBusiness Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,\\nor the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal control and may require that we have\\nsuch system of internal control audited. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control, we could be subject to regulatory\\nscrutiny, civil or criminal penalties and/or stockholder litigation. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports could\\nharm our business. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm report\\non management’s evaluation of our system of internal control, although as an “emerging growth company” as defined\\nin the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of an exemption to this requirement. A target company may not be in compliance with the\\nprovisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal control. The development of the internal control of any\\nsuch entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such initial\\nBusiness Combination. Furthermore, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the\\nimplementation of adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, could harm our operating results\\nor cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inferior internal control could also cause investors to lose confidence\\nin our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\\n\\xa0\\nWe are an emerging growth company within\\nthe meaning of the Securities Act, and certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies could\\nmake our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\\n\\xa0\\nThe JOBS Act permits “emerging growth\\ncompanies” like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public\\ncompanies that are not emerging growth companies. As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we intend to omit the auditor’s\\nattestation on internal control over financial reporting that would otherwise be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as described\\nabove. We also intend to take advantage of the exemption provided under the JOBS Act from the requirements to submit say-on-pay,\\nsay-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute votes to our stockholders and we will avail ourselves of reduced executive compensation\\ndisclosure that is already available to smaller reporting companies.\\n\\xa0\\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also\\nprovides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards\\nprovided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can\\ntherefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\\nWe have elected to take advantage of these benefits until we are no longer an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively\\nand irrevocably opt out of this exemption. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that\\ncomply with such new or revised accounting standards.\\n\\xa0\\nWe will continue to be an emerging growth company\\nuntil the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least\\n$1 billion (as indexed for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the\\nfirst public sale of Units, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion\\nin non-convertible debt, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” as defined under\\nthe Exchange Act.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa026\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nUntil such time that we lose “emerging\\ngrowth company” status, it is unclear if investors will find our securities less attractive because we may rely on these\\nexemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our\\nsecurities and our stock prices may be more volatile and could cause our stock prices to decline.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we effect our initial Business Combination\\nwith a company located outside of the United States, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact\\nour operations.\\n\\xa0\\nWe may effect our initial Business Combination\\nwith a company located outside of the United States. If we did, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated\\nwith companies operating in the target business’ home jurisdiction, including any of the following:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nrules and regulations or currency conversion or corporate withholding taxes on individuals;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\ntariffs and trade barriers;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nregulations related to customs and import/export matters;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nlonger payment cycles;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\ntax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\ncurrency fluctuations and exchange controls;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nchallenges in collecting accounts receivable;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\ncultural and language differences;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nemployment regulations;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\ncrime, strikes, riots, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks and wars; and\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\ndeterioration of political relations with the United States.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWe may not be able to adequately address these\\nadditional risks. If we are unable to do so, our operations may suffer.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we effect our initial Business Combination\\nwith a target business located outside of the United States, the laws applicable to such target business will likely govern all\\nof our material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we effect our initial Business Combination\\nwith a target business located outside of the United States, the laws of the country in which such target business is domiciled\\nwill govern almost all of the material agreements relating to its operations. The target business may not be able to enforce any\\nof its material agreements in such jurisdiction and appropriate remedies to enforce its rights under such material agreements may\\nnot be available in this new jurisdiction. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not\\nbe as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any\\nof our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital. Additionally, if we\\nconsummate our initial Business Combination with a company located outside of the United States, it is likely that substantially\\nall of our assets would be located outside of the United States and some of our officers and directors might reside outside of\\nthe United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights, to effect\\nservice of process upon our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities\\nand criminal penalties of our directors and officers under Federal securities laws.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa027\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nProvisions in our amended and restated\\ncertificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might\\nbe willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.\\n\\xa0\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation\\ncontains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests.\\nThese provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and\\nissue new series of preferred shares, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that\\notherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. We are also subject to anti-takeover\\nprovisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult\\nthe removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market\\nprices for our securities.\\n\\xa0\\nBecause we must furnish our stockholders\\nwith target business financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or international\\nfinancial reporting standards, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial Business Combination with\\nsome prospective target businesses.\\n\\xa0\\nThe federal proxy rules require that a proxy\\nstatement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or\\npro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance\\nwith, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international\\nfinancial reporting standards, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required\\nto be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These\\nfinancial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may consummate our initial Business Combination\\nwith because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with\\nfederal proxy rules and complete our initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame.\\n\\xa0\\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a\\nfailure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\\n\\xa0\\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted\\nby national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements.\\nCompliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly.

       "'Risk Factors\\n\\xa0\\nThe risks and uncertainties described below\\nare those specific to the Company which we currently believe have the potential to be material, but they may not be the only ones\\nwe face. If any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that we have not yet identified or that we currently\\nconsider not to be material, actually occur or become material risks, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of\\noperations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Investors are advised to consider these factors along with\\nthe other information included in this Annual Report and to review any additional risks discussed in our filings with the SEC.\\n\\xa0\\nRisks Associated with Our Business\\n\\xa0\\nWe are a newly formed company with no operating history and, accordingly, you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business\\nobjective.\\n\\xa0\\nSince we lack an operating history, you have\\nno basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective, which is to complete our initial Business Combination\\nwith one or more target businesses. We have no plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective target business concerning\\na Business Combination and may be unable to complete our Business Combination. If we fail to complete our Business Combination,\\nwe will never generate any operating revenues.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we are unable to consummate our initial\\nBusiness Combination, our public stockholders may be forced to wait more than 24 months before receiving distributions from the\\nTrust Account.\\n\\xa0\\nWe will have until 18 months from the closing\\nof our Offering (or 24 months from the closing of our Offering if we have executed a letter of intent or definitive agreement for\\nan initial Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of our Offering but have not completed the initial Business Combination\\nwithin such 18-month period) to consummate our initial Business Combination. We have no obligation to return funds to investors\\nprior to such date unless we consummate our initial Business Combination prior thereto and only then in cases where investors have\\nsought to convert their shares. Only after the expiration of this full time period will holders of our common stock be entitled\\nto distributions from the Trust Account if we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination. Accordingly, investors’\\nfunds may be unavailable to them until after such date and to liquidate your investment, public security holders may be forced\\nto sell their public shares, potentially at a loss.\\n\\xa0\\nYou will not be entitled to protections\\nnormally afforded to investors of blank check companies.\\n\\xa0\\nSince the net proceeds of our Offering are\\nintended to be used to complete our initial Business Combination with a target business that has not been identified, we may be\\ndeemed to be a “blank check” company under the United States securities laws. However, since we have net tangible assets\\nin excess of $5,000,001 and have filed a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact,\\nwe are exempt from Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules which would,\\nfor example, completely restrict the transferability of our securities, require us to complete our initial Business Combination\\nwithin 18 months of the effective date of the initial registration statement and restrict the use of interest earned on the funds\\nheld in the Trust Account. Because we are not subject to Rule 419, our Units became immediately tradable, we are entitled to withdraw\\ncertain amounts from the funds held in the Trust Account prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination and we have\\na longer period of time to complete such a Business Combination than we would if we were subject to Rule 419.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa010\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf we determine to change our acquisition\\ncriteria or guidelines, many of the disclosures contained in this Annual Report regarding our acquisition criteria or guidelines\\nwould no longer apply.\\n\\xa0\\nWe could seek to deviate from the acquisition\\ncriteria or guidelines disclosed in this Annual Report although we have no current intention to do so. For instance, as required\\nby Nasdaq, we currently anticipate structuring a Business Combination with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair\\nmarket value that is at least equal to 80% of the value of the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriter’s fees and\\ntaxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the execution of a letter of intent or definitive agreement\\nfor a Business Combination. However, we could be delisted from Nasdaq and therefore no longer be required to meet this requirement.\\nFurthermore, there are numerous agreements between us and our affiliates that could be amended between the parties without approval\\nof public stockholders. In such event, many of the acquisition criteria and guidelines set forth in this Annual Report (such as\\nthe voting, transfer and liquidation restrictions agreed to by the holders of the Insider Shares described in the prospectus associated\\nwith our initial public offering, the indemnification obligations of Kingsway and FMG described below and the obligations of Kingsway\\nand FMG to pay the cost of liquidation if the funds held outside the Trust Account are insufficient for such purposes) may no longer\\napply.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we deviate from the acquisition criteria\\nor guidelines set forth in this Annual Report, holders of our securities may have rescission rights or may bring an action for\\ndamages against us or we could be subject to civil or criminal actions taken by governmental authorities.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we were to elect to deviate from the acquisition\\ncriteria or guidelines set forth in this Annual Report or in the prospectus associated with our initial public offering, each person\\nwho purchased Units in our Offering and still held such securities upon learning of the facts relating to the deviation may seek\\nrescission of the purchase of the Units he or she acquired in the offering (under which a successful claimant has the right to\\nreceive the total amount paid for his or her securities, plus interest and less any income earned on the securities, in exchange\\nfor surrender of the securities) or bring an action for damages against us (compensation for loss on an investment caused by alleged\\nmaterial misrepresentations or omissions in the sale of a security). In such event, we could also be subject to civil or criminal\\nactions taken by governmental authorities. For instance, the SEC can seek injunctions under Section 20(b) of the Securities Act\\nif it believes a violation under the Securities Act has occurred or is imminent. The SEC can also seek civil penalties under Sections\\n20(d) and 24 if a party has violated the Securities Act or an injunctive action taken by the SEC or if a party willfully, in a\\nregistration statement filed under the Securities Act, makes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material\\nfact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Furthermore, Section 20 allows the\\nSEC to refer matters to the attorney general to bring criminal penalties against an issuer.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa011\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe may issue shares of our capital stock\\nto complete our initial Business Combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and likely cause a change\\nin control of our ownership.\\n\\xa0\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation\\ncurrently authorizes the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares\\nof preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. We may issue a substantial number of additional shares of common stock or shares\\nof preferred stock, or a combination of common stock and preferred stock, to complete our initial Business Combination. The issuance\\nof additional shares of common stock or preferred stock:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nMay significantly reduce the equity interest of investors in our securities;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nmay subordinate the rights of holders of shares of common stock if we issue shares of preferred stock with rights senior to those afforded to our shares of common stock;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nmay cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nmay adversely affect prevailing market prices for our shares of common stock.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWe may issue notes or other debt securities,\\nor otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a Business Combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial\\ncondition and thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders’ investment in us.\\n\\xa0\\nWe may choose to incur substantial debt to\\ncomplete our Business Combination. However, the incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\ndefault and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after our initial Business Combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nacceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nour immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nour inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding; and\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nlimitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe funds held in the Trust Account may\\nnot earn significant interest and, as a result, we may be limited to the funds held outside of the Trust Account to fund our search\\nfor target businesses, to pay our tax obligations and to complete our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe depend on sufficient interest being earned\\non the proceeds held in the Trust Account to provide us with additional working capital we may need to identify one or more target\\nbusinesses and to complete our initial Business Combination, as well as to pay any tax obligations that we may owe. Interest rates\\non permissible investments for us have been less than 1% over the last several years. Accordingly, if we do not earn a sufficient\\namount of interest on the funds held in the Trust Account and use all of the funds held outside of the Trust Account, we may not\\nhave sufficient funds available with which to structure, negotiate or close our initial Business Combination. In such event, we\\nwould need to borrow funds from our insiders, officers or directors to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Our insiders, officers\\nand directors are under no obligation to loan us any funds. If we are unable to obtain the funds necessary, we may be forced to\\ncease searching for a target business and may be unable to complete our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa012\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe may not have sufficient working capital\\nto cover our operating expenses.\\n\\xa0\\nFollowing the consummation of the Offering\\nand after paying offering related expenses, the amounts available to us to pay our operating expenses have consisted primarily\\nof the approximately $575,000 initially held outside of the Trust Account and any interest earned on the funds in the Trust Account\\nremaining after interest is released to pay our income or other tax obligations. Additionally, we may delay payment of the $10,000\\nmonthly fee payable to 1347 Capital LLC upon a determination by our audit committee that we lack sufficient funds held outside\\nthe trust to pay actual or anticipated expenses in connection with our initial business combination, with any such unpaid amount\\naccruing without interest and becoming due and payable no later than the date of the consummation of our initial business combination.\\nHowever, the amounts available to us, even if we cease paying the $10,000 monthly fee to 1347 Capital LLC, may not be sufficient\\nto fund our operating expenses. In such event, we would need to borrow funds from our insiders, officers or directors or from third\\nparties to continue to operate. However, our insiders, officers and directors and third parties are under no obligation to loan\\nus any funds. If we are unable to obtain the necessary funds, we may be forced to cease searching for a target business and liquidate\\nwithout completing our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nReimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses\\nincurred by our insiders, officers, directors or any of their affiliates in connection with certain activities on our behalf, such\\nas identifying and investigating possible business targets for a Business Combination, could reduce the funds available to us to\\nconsummate a Business Combination. In addition, an indemnification claim by one or more of our officers and directors in the event\\nthat any of them are sued in their capacity as an officer or director could also reduce the funds available to us outside of the\\nTrust Account.\\n\\xa0\\nWe reimburse our insiders, officers, directors\\nor any of their affiliates for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with certain activities on our behalf, such as identifying\\nand investigating possible business targets for a Business Combination. There is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses\\nreimbursable by us; provided, that, to the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the Trust Account\\nand the interest income earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account that may be released to us, such expenses would not be\\nreimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial Business Combination. In addition, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate\\nof incorporation and Delaware law, we may be required to indemnify our officers and directors in the event that any of them are\\nsued in their capacity as an officer or director. We have also entered into agreements with our officers and directors to provide\\ncontractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation\\nand under Delaware law. In the event that we reimburse our insiders, officers, directors or any of their affiliates for out-of-pocket\\nexpenses prior to the consummation of a Business Combination or are required to indemnify any of our officers or directors pursuant\\nto our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, Delaware law, or the indemnity agreements that we have entered into with\\nthem, we would use funds available to us outside of the Trust Account or interest released to us from the Trust Account for our\\nworking capital requirements. Any reduction in the funds available to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to\\nlocate and investigate prospective target businesses and to structure, negotiate, conduct due diligence in connection with or consummate\\nour initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa013\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf third parties bring claims against\\nus, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per-share redemption price received by stockholders may be\\nless than approximately $10.00.\\n\\xa0\\nOur placing of funds in the Trust Account may\\nnot protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors and service providers we\\nengage and prospective target businesses we negotiate with execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim\\nof any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public stockholders, they may not execute such\\nagreements. Furthermore, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they may seek recourse against the Trust Account.\\nA court may not uphold the validity of such agreements. Accordingly, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to\\nclaims which could take priority over those of our public stockholders. If we are unable to complete an initial Business Combination\\nwithin the required time period, Kingsway and FMG have agreed that they will be jointly and severally liable to ensure that the\\nproceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are\\nowed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but only if such a vendor or prospective target\\nbusiness does not execute such a waiver. However, Kingsway and FMG may not be able to meet such obligation as we have not required\\nKingsway and FMG to retain any assets to provide for their indemnification obligations, nor have we taken any further steps to\\nensure that Kingsway and FMG will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that arise. Moreover, Kingsway and FMG will\\nnot be liable to our public stockholders if they should fail to satisfy their obligations under this agreement and instead will\\nonly be liable to us. Therefore, the per share redemption or conversion amount received by public stockholders may be less than\\napproximately $10.00 due to such claims.\\n\\xa0\\nAdditionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy\\ncase or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could\\nbe subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties\\nwith priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, the per share\\nredemption or conversion amount received by public stockholders may be less than $10.00.\\n\\xa0\\nOur stockholders may be held liable for\\nclaims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we have not completed our initial Business\\nCombination within 18 months from the closing of our Offering (or 24 months from the closing of our Offering if we have entered\\ninto a letter of intent or definitive agreement with a target business for a Business Combination within 18 months from the closing\\nof our Offering but the Business Combination has not been consummated within such 18-month period), we will (i) cease all operations\\nexcept for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem\\n100% of the outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account which redemption will completely\\nextinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions,\\nif any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval\\nof our remaining holders of common stock and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii)\\nabove) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. We\\nmay not properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable\\nfor any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well\\nbeyond the third anniversary of the date of distribution. Accordingly, third parties may seek to recover from our stockholders\\namounts owed to them by us.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa014\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds\\nin the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against\\nus that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be\\nviewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us\\nto claims of punitive damages.\\n\\xa0\\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the\\nTrust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against\\nus that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy\\nlaws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court\\ncould seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached\\nits fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages,\\nby paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.\\n\\xa0\\nIf, before distributing the proceeds\\nin the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against\\nus that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our stockholders and\\nthe per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\\n\\xa0\\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the\\nTrust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against\\nus that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included\\nin our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent\\nany bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection\\nwith our liquidation may be reduced.\\n\\xa0\\nUnlike other blank check companies, our\\nUnits are comprised of common stock, warrants to purchase one-half of one share of our common stock and rights, rather than units\\ncomprised of common stock and warrants to purchase one share of our common stock.\\n\\xa0\\nUnlike other blank check companies that sell\\nunits comprised of shares of common stock and warrants to purchase one share of our common stock in their initial public offerings,\\nwe issued Units comprised of shares of common stock, warrants to purchase one-half of one share of our common stock and rights\\nautomatically entitling the holder to receive one-tenth of a share of common stock upon consummation of our initial Business Combination.\\nNeither the rights nor the warrants will have any voting rights and each will expire and be worthless if we do not consummate an\\ninitial Business Combination. Furthermore, no fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. As a result, unless\\nyou acquire at least two warrants, you will not be able to receive a share of common stock upon exercise of your warrants. Accordingly,\\ninvestors in our Offering were not issued as many shares as part of their investment as they may have in other blank check company\\nofferings, which may have the effect of limiting the potential upside value of your investment in our company.\\n\\xa0\\nHolders of rights and warrants will not\\nhave redemption rights if we are unable to complete an initial Business Combination within the required time period.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we are unable to complete an initial Business\\nCombination within the required time period and we redeem our outstanding public shares using the funds held in the Trust Account,\\nthe rights and warrants will expire and holders thereof will not receive any of such proceeds with respect to such rights and warrants,\\nrespectively.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa015\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe requirement that our initial Business\\nCombination occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of\\nthe Trust Account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial Business Combination may limit the type\\nand number of companies that we may complete such a Business Combination with.\\n\\xa0\\nPursuant to the Nasdaq listing rules, our initial\\nBusiness Combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80%\\nof the value of the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriter’s fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the\\nTrust Account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial Business Combination. This restriction may\\nlimit the type and number of companies that we may complete a Business Combination with. If we are unable to locate a target business\\nor businesses that satisfy this fair market value test, we may be forced to liquidate and you will only be entitled to receive\\nyour pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account.\\n\\xa0\\nOur management may not be able to maintain\\ncontrol of a target business after our initial Business Combination. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of\\na target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business.\\n\\xa0\\nWe may structure our initial Business Combination\\nsuch that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order\\nto meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Business\\nCombination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or\\notherwise owns or acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment\\ncompany under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities\\nof the target, our stockholders prior to the Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction\\ncompany, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue\\na transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target.\\nIn this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial\\nnumber of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of\\nour outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. In addition, other minority stockholders may subsequently\\ncombine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company’s stock than we initially\\nacquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control of the target\\nbusiness.\\n\\xa0\\nOur ability to successfully effect our\\ninitial Business Combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some\\nof whom may join us following our initial Business Combination. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage\\nafter our initial Business Combination, our assessment of these individuals may not prove to be correct.\\n\\xa0\\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial\\nBusiness Combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. We believe that our success depends on the continued service\\nof our key personnel, at least until we have consummated our initial Business Combination. None of our officers are required to\\ncommit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, they will have conflicts of interest in allocating management\\ntime among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.\\nIf our officers’ and directors’ other business affairs require them to devote more substantial amounts of time to their\\nother business activities, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs and could have a negative impact on our ability\\nto consummate our initial Business Combination. In addition, we do not have employment agreements with, or key-man insurance on\\nthe life of, any of our officers. The unexpected loss of the services of our key personnel could have a detrimental effect on us.\\nThe role of our key personnel after our initial Business Combination, however, remains to be determined. Although some of our key\\npersonnel serve in senior management or advisory positions following our initial Business Combination, it is likely that most,\\nif not all, of the management of the target business will remain in place. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements\\nof operating a public company which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such\\nrequirements. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect\\nour operations.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa016\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nOur officers and directors may not have\\nsignificant experience or knowledge regarding the jurisdiction or industry of the target business we may seek to consummate our\\ninitial Business Combination with.\\n\\xa0\\nWe may consummate a business combination with\\na target business in any geographic location or industry we choose. Our officers and directors may not have enough experience or\\nsufficient knowledge relating to the jurisdiction of the target or its industry to make an informed decision regarding our initial\\nBusiness Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nOur key personnel may negotiate employment\\nor consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular Business Combination. These agreements may provide\\nfor them to receive compensation following our initial Business Combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of\\ninterest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.\\n\\xa0\\nOur key personnel may be able to remain with\\nthe company after the completion of our Business Combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements\\nin connection with the Business Combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the Business\\nCombination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for\\nservices they would render to us after the completion of the Business Combination. The personal and financial interests of such\\nindividuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business.\\n\\xa0\\nMembers of our management team may have\\naffiliations with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and accordingly, may\\nhave conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\\n\\xa0\\nMembers of our management team may have affiliations\\nwith companies, including companies that are engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us. Accordingly,\\nthey may participate in transactions and have obligations that may be in conflict or competition with our consummation of our initial\\nBusiness Combination. As a result, a potential target business may be presented by our management team to another entity prior\\nto its presentation to us and we may not be afforded the opportunity to engage in a transaction with such target business.\\n\\xa0\\nWe may engage in a Business Combination\\nwith one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our executive officers, directors\\nor insiders, which may raise potential conflicts of interest.\\n\\xa0\\nIn light of the involvement of our insiders,\\nofficers, and directors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our insiders, officers,\\nand directors. Our directors and officers also serve as officers and board members for other entities. Although we will not be\\nspecifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we\\ndetermined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for a Business Combination, such transaction was approved by a majority\\nof our disinterested and independent directors (if we have any at that time), and we obtain an opinion from an independent investment\\nbanking firm that the Business Combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view. Despite our\\nagreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm regarding the fairness to our company from a financial\\npoint of view of a Business Combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our officers, directors\\nor insiders, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the Business Combination may not be\\nas advantageous to our public stockholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa017\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe shares beneficially owned by our\\ninsiders, officers and directors will not participate in a redemption and, therefore, our insiders, officers and directors may\\nhave a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nOur insiders, officers and directors have waived\\ntheir right to convert their Insider Shares, Private Units, $15 Exercise Price Sponsor Warrants, or to redemption rights with respect\\nto their Insider Shares, Private Units or $15 Exercise Price Sponsor Warrants upon a redemption if we are unable to consummate\\nour initial Business Combination. Accordingly, these securities will be worthless if we do not consummate our initial Business\\nCombination. Any rights and warrants they hold, like those held by the public, will also be worthless if we do not consummate an\\ninitial Business Combination. The personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation\\nin timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a Business Combination. Consequently, our directors’\\nand officers’ discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when\\ndetermining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular Business Combination are appropriate and in our stockholders’\\nbest interest.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we are unable to consummate a Business\\nCombination, any loans made by our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates would not be repaid, resulting in a potential\\nconflict of interest in determining whether a potential transaction is in our stockholders’ best interest.\\n\\xa0\\nIn order to meet our working capital needs\\nour insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any\\ntime, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. The loans would be non-interest bearing and would be payable\\nat the consummation of a Business Combination. If we fail to consummate a Business Combination within the required time period,\\nthe loans would not be repaid. Consequently, our directors and officers may have a conflict of interest in determining whether\\nthe terms, conditions and timing of a particular Business Combination are appropriate and in our stockholders’ best interest.\\n\\xa0\\nNasdaq may delist our securities from\\nquotation on its exchange which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional\\ntrading restrictions.\\n\\xa0\\nOur securities are currently listed on Nasdaq.\\nWe currently do not meet the 300 public holders requirement for Nasdaq listing, but have been granted approval by Nasdaq to show\\ncompliance with this rule by July 7, 2016. Although we expect to meet the listing standards of Nasdaq, we cannot assure you that\\nour securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq in the future or prior to our initial Business Combination. In order to continue\\nlisting our securities on Nasdaq prior to our initial Business Combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and\\nstock price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum amount in stockholders’ equity (generally $2,500,000) and a minimum\\nnumber of holders of our securities (generally 300 public holders). We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to meet\\nthose Nasdaq’s listing requirements.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa018\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf Nasdaq delists our securities from trading\\non its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nreduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\na determination that our shares are a “penny stock,” which will require brokers trading in our shares to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWe may only be able to complete one Business\\nCombination with the proceeds of our Offering, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a\\nlimited number of products or services.\\n\\xa0\\nIt is likely we will consummate our initial\\nBusiness Combination with a single target business, although we have the ability to simultaneously consummate our initial Business\\nCombination with several target businesses. By consummating a Business Combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification\\nmay subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations\\nor benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to\\ncomplete several Business Combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects\\nfor our success may be:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nsolely dependent upon the performance of a single business, or\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\ndependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThis lack of diversification may subject us\\nto numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the\\nparticular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nAlternatively, if we determine to simultaneously\\nconsummate our initial Business Combination with several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will\\nneed for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other\\nBusiness Combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the Business Combination. With\\nmultiple Business Combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible\\nmultiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with\\nthe subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the target companies in a single operating business.\\nIf we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa019\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe ability of our public stockholders\\nto exercise their conversion rights may not allow us to effectuate the most desirable Business Combination or optimize our capital\\nstructure.\\n\\xa0\\nIf our initial Business Combination requires\\nus to use substantially all of our cash to pay the purchase price, because we will not know how many public stockholders may exercise\\nconversion rights, we may either need to reserve part of the Trust Account for possible payment upon such conversion, or we may\\nneed to arrange third party financing to help fund our initial Business Combination. In the event that the Business Combination\\ninvolves the issuance of our stock as consideration, we may be required to issue a higher percentage of our stock to make up for\\na shortfall in funds. Raising additional funds to cover any shortfall may involve dilutive equity financing or incurring indebtedness\\nat higher than desirable levels. This may limit our ability to effectuate the most attractive Business Combination available to\\nus.\\n\\xa0\\nWe may be unable to consummate an initial\\nBusiness Combination if a target business requires that we have a certain amount of cash at closing, in which case public stockholders\\nmay have to remain stockholders of our company and wait until our redemption of the public shares to receive a pro rata share of\\nthe Trust Account or attempt to sell their shares in the open market.\\n\\xa0\\nA potential target may make it a closing condition\\nto our initial Business Combination that we have a certain amount of cash in excess of the $5,000,001 of net tangible assets we\\nare required to have pursuant to our organizational documents available at the time of closing. If the number of our public stockholders\\nelecting to exercise their conversion rights has the effect of reducing the amount of money available to us to consummate an initial\\nBusiness Combination below such minimum amount required by the target business and we are not able to locate an alternative source\\nof funding, we will not be able to consummate such initial Business Combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable\\ntarget within the applicable time period, if at all. In that case, public stockholders may have to remain stockholders of our company\\nand wait the full 24 months in order to be able to receive a portion of the Trust Account, or attempt to sell their shares in the\\nopen market prior to such time, in which case they may receive less than they would have in a liquidation of the Trust Account.\\n\\xa0\\nWe will offer each public stockholder\\nthe option to vote in favor of the proposed Business Combination and still seek conversion of his, her or its shares.\\n\\xa0\\nIn connection with any meeting held to approve\\nan initial Business Combination, we will offer each public stockholder (but not our sponsors, officers or directors) the right\\nto have his, her or its shares of common stock converted to cash regardless of whether such stockholder votes for or against such\\nproposed Business Combination; provided that a stockholder must in fact vote for or against a proposed Business Combination in\\norder to have his, her or its shares of common stock converted to cash. If a stockholder fails to vote for or against a proposed\\nBusiness Combination, that stockholder would not be able to have his shares of common stock so converted. We will consummate our\\ninitial Business Combination only if public stockholders do not exercise conversion rights in an amount that would cause our net\\ntangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of\\nthe Business Combination. Accordingly, public stockholders owning 4,099,999 shares of common stock sold in our Offering may exercise\\ntheir conversion rights and we could still consummate a proposed Business Combination so long as a majority of shares voted at\\nthe meeting are voted in favor of the proposed Business Combination. This is different than other similarly structured blank check\\ncompanies where stockholders are offered the right to convert their shares only when they vote against a proposed Business Combination.\\nThis threshold and the ability to seek conversion while voting in favor of a proposed Business Combination may make it more likely\\nthat we will consummate our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa020\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nA public stockholder that fails to vote\\neither in favor of or against a proposed Business Combination will not be able to have his or her shares converted to cash.\\n\\xa0\\nIn order for a public stockholder to have his\\nor her shares converted to cash in connection with any proposed Business Combination, that public stockholder must vote either\\nin favor of or against a proposed Business Combination. If a public stockholder fails to vote in favor of or against a proposed\\nBusiness Combination, whether that stockholder abstains from the vote or simply does not vote, that stockholder would not be able\\nto have his or her shares of common stock so converted to cash in connection with such Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nPublic stockholders, together with any\\naffiliates of theirs or any other person with whom they are acting in concert or as a “group,” will be restricted from\\nseeking conversion rights with respect to more than 20% of the shares of common stock sold in our Offering.\\n\\xa0\\nIn connection with any meeting held to approve\\nan initial Business Combination, we will offer each public stockholder (but not our insiders, officers or directors) the right\\nto have his, her, or its shares of common stock converted into cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public stockholder, together\\nwith any affiliate of his or hers, or any other person with whom he or she is acting in concert or as a “group” will\\nbe restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to more than 20% of the shares of common stock sold in our Offering.\\nGenerally, in this context, a stockholder will be deemed to be acting in concert or as a group with another stockholder when such\\nstockholders agree to act together for the purpose of acquiring, voting, holding or disposing of our equity securities. Accordingly,\\nif you purchase more than 20% of the shares of common stock sold in our Offering and our proposed Business Combination is approved,\\nyou will not be able to seek conversion rights with respect to the full amount of your shares and may be forced to hold such additional\\nshares of common stock or sell them in the open market. The value of such additional shares may not appreciate over time following\\nour initial Business Combination, and the market price of our shares of common stock may not exceed the per-share conversion price.\\n\\xa0\\nWe may require public stockholders who\\nwish to convert their shares of common stock in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements\\nfor conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising\\ntheir rights.\\n\\xa0\\nIn connection with any stockholder meeting\\ncalled to approve a proposed initial Business Combination, each public stockholder will have the right, regardless of whether he\\nor she is voting for or against such proposed Business Combination, to demand that we convert his or her shares of common stock\\ninto a share of the Trust Account. We may require public stockholders seeking to convert their shares, whether they are a record\\nholder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent or to deliver\\ntheir shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian)\\nSystem, at the holder’s option, at least two business days prior to the vote on the initial Business Combination. In order\\nto obtain a physical stock certificate, a stockholder’s broker and/or clearing broker, DTC and our transfer agent will need\\nto act to facilitate this request. It is our understanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain\\nphysical certificates from the transfer agent. However, because we do not have any control over this process or over the brokers\\nor DTC, it may take significantly longer than two weeks to obtain a physical stock certificate. While we have been advised that\\nit takes a short time to deliver shares through the DWAC System, this may not be the case. Under Delaware law and our bylaws, we\\nare required to provide at least 10 days advance notice of any stockholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a\\npublic stockholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. Accordingly, if it takes longer than we anticipate\\nfor stockholders to deliver their shares, stockholders who wish to convert may be unable to meet the deadline for exercising their\\nconversion rights and thus may be unable to convert their shares.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa021\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf we require public stockholders who wish to convert their\\nshares of common stock to comply with the delivery requirements discussed above for conversion, such converting stockholders may\\nbe unable to sell their securities when they wish to in the event that the proposed Business Combination is not approved.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we require public stockholders who wish\\nto convert their shares of common stock to comply with the delivery requirements discussed above for conversion and such proposed\\nBusiness Combination is not consummated, we will promptly return such certificates to the tendering public stockholders. Accordingly,\\ninvestors who attempted to convert their shares in such a circumstance will be unable to sell their securities after the failed\\nBusiness Combination until we have returned their securities to them. The market price for our shares of common stock may decline\\nduring this time and you may not be able to sell your securities when you wish to, even while other stockholders that did not seek\\nconversion may be able to sell their securities.\\n\\xa0\\nBecause of our structure, other companies\\nmay have a competitive advantage and we may not be able to consummate an attractive Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nWe expect to encounter intense competition\\nfrom entities other than blank check companies having a business objective similar to ours, including venture capital funds, leveraged\\nbuyout funds and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive\\nexperience in identifying and effecting Business Combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess\\ngreater technical, human and other resources than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted\\nwith those of many of these competitors. Therefore, our ability to compete in consummating our initial Business Combination with\\ncertain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives\\nothers an advantage in pursuing a Business Combination with certain target businesses. Furthermore, seeking stockholder approval\\nof our initial Business Combination may delay the consummation of a transaction. Additionally, our rights and warrants, and the\\nfuture dilution they represent (entitling the holders to receive shares of our common stock on exercise of the warrants or, with\\nrespect to the rights, on consummation of our initial Business Combination), may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses.\\nAny of the foregoing may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nOur ability to consummate an attractive\\nBusiness Combination may be impacted by the market for initial public offerings.\\n\\xa0\\nIf the market for initial public offerings\\nis limited, we believe there will be a greater number of attractive target businesses open to consummating an initial Business\\nCombination with us as a means to achieve publicly held status. Alternatively, if the market for initial public offerings is robust,\\nwe believe that there will be fewer attractive target businesses amenable to consummating an initial Business Combination with\\nus to become a public reporting company. Accordingly, during periods with strong public offering markets, it may be more difficult\\nfor us to complete an initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nWe may be unable to obtain additional\\nfinancing, if required, to complete our initial Business Combination or to fund the operations and growth of the target business,\\nwhich could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination.\\n\\xa0\\nIf the net proceeds of our Offering prove to\\nbe insufficient, either because of the size of the Business Combination, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search\\nof a target business, or the obligation to convert into cash a significant number of shares of common stock, we will be required\\nto seek additional financing. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional\\nfinancing proves to be unavailable when needed to consummate a particular Business Combination, we would be compelled to either\\nrestructure the transaction or abandon that particular Business Combination and seek an alternative target business candidate.\\nIn addition, if we consummate a Business Combination, we may require additional financing to fund the operations or growth of the\\ntarget business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or\\ngrowth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection\\nwith or after our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa022\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nOur insiders, officers and directors,\\nwill control a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a stockholder vote.\\n\\xa0\\nOur insiders, officers and directors, collectively\\nown 22.7% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. None of our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates has\\nindicated to us any intention to purchase shares from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, our insiders,\\nofficers, directors or their affiliates could determine in the future to make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions,\\nto the extent permitted by law, in order to influence the vote. In connection with any vote for a proposed Business Combination,\\nour insiders, officers and directors have agreed to vote the shares of common stock owned by them immediately before our Offering\\nas well as the private shares and any shares of common stock acquired in our Offering or in the aftermarket in favor of such proposed\\nBusiness Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nIf our security holders exercise their\\nregistration rights, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares of common stock and the existence of these\\nrights may make it more difficult to effect our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nOur insiders are entitled to make a demand\\nthat we register the resale of the Insider Shares at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which their shares may\\nbe released from escrow. Additionally, the purchasers of the Private Units and $15 Exercise Price Sponsor Warrants and our insiders,\\nofficers, directors or their affiliates are entitled to demand that we register the resale of the Private Units and $15 Exercise\\nPrice Sponsor Warrants (and underlying securities of each) and any shares our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates\\nmay be issued in payment of working capital loans made to us commencing on the date that we consummate our initial Business Combination.\\nThe presence of these additional shares of common stock trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price\\nof our securities. In addition, the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effectuate our initial Business Combination\\nor increase the cost of consummating our initial Business Combination with the target business, as the stockholders of the target\\nbusiness may be discouraged from entering into a Business Combination with us or will request a higher price for their securities\\nbecause of the potential effect the exercise of such rights may have on the trading market for our shares of common stock.\\n\\xa0\\nEarlyBirdCapital may have a conflict\\nof interest in rendering services to us as our non-exclusive investment banker in connection with our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nWe have engaged EarlyBirdCapital as an investment\\nbanker to assist us with our initial Business Combination. We will pay EarlyBirdCapital a cash fee for such services upon the consummation\\nof our initial Business Combination in an amount equal to 3.5% of the total gross proceeds raised in the Offering, less up to 30%\\nof such fee that we may allocate to one or more other advisors that assist us in identifying or consummating an initial Business\\nCombination (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might become payable). Additionally, EarlyBirdCapital was issued\\nunit purchase options in connection with our Offering. These financial interests may result in EarlyBirdCapital having a conflict\\nof interest when providing the services to us as our investment banker in connection with an initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa023\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf we are deemed to be an investment\\ncompany, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make\\nit difficult for us to complete our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company\\nunder the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nrestrictions on the nature of our investments; and\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nrestrictions on the issuance of securities, each of which may make it difficult for us to complete our Business Combination. \\n\\n\\xa0\\nIn addition, we may have imposed upon us certain\\nburdensome requirements, including:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nregistration as an investment company;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nadoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nreporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIn order not to be regulated as an investment\\ncompany under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily\\nin a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading in securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting,\\nowning, holding or trading “investment securities” constituting more than 40% of our total assets (exclusive of U.S.\\ngovernment securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business will be to identify and complete a Business Combination\\nand thereafter to operate the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets\\nwith a view to resale or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor.\\n\\xa0\\nWe do not believe that our anticipated principal\\nactivities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the Trust Account may only be invested\\nin United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having\\na maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment\\nCompany Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not\\npermitted to invest in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having\\na business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in\\nthe manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an “investment company” within\\nthe meaning of the Investment Company Act.. The Trust Account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earlier to occur\\nof either: (i) the completion of our primary business objective, which is a Business Combination; or (ii) absent a Business Combination,\\nour return of the funds held in the Trust Account to our public stockholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. If\\nwe do not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed\\nto be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses\\nfor which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete a Business Combination. If we are unable to complete\\nour initial Business Combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of\\nour Trust Account and our public rights and public warrants will expire worthless.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa024\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe requirement that we complete our\\ninitial Business Combination within 18 or 24 months from the closing of our Offering may give potential target businesses leverage\\nover us in negotiating our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nWe have 18 months from the closing of our offering\\n(or 24 months from the closing of our offering if we have executed a letter of intent or definitive agreement for an initial Business\\nCombination within 18 months from the closing of our Offering but have not completed the Business Combination within such 18-month\\nperiod) to complete our initial Business Combination. Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning\\na Business Combination will be aware of this requirement. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating\\na Business Combination, knowing that if we do not complete a Business Combination with that particular target business, we may\\nbe unable to complete a Business Combination with any other target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the time\\nlimit referenced above.\\n\\xa0\\nWe may not obtain a fairness opinion\\nwith respect to the target business that we seek to consummate our initial Business Combination with and therefore you may be relying\\nsolely on the judgment of our board of directors in approving a proposed Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nWe will only be required to obtain a fairness\\nopinion with respect to the target business that we seek to consummate our initial Business Combination with if it is an entity\\nthat is affiliated with any of our insiders, officers or directors. In all other instances, we will have no obligation to obtain\\nan opinion. Accordingly, investors may be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors in approving a proposed Business\\nCombination.\\n\\xa0\\nWe are not required to obtain an opinion\\nfrom an independent investment banking or accounting firm, and consequently, you may have no assurance from an independent source\\nthat the price we are paying for the business is fair to our company from a financial point of view.\\n\\xa0\\nUnless we complete our Business Combination\\nwith an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking or accounting firm that\\nthe price we are paying is fair to our company from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our stockholders will\\nbe relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted\\nby the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials,\\nas applicable, related to our initial Business Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nResources could be wasted in researching\\nbusiness combinations that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire\\nor merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination, our public stockholders may receive\\nonly approximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our public rights and public warrants will expire\\nworthless.\\n\\xa0\\nWe anticipate that the investigation of each\\nspecific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments\\nwill require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide\\nnot to complete a specific initial Business Combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely\\nwould not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete\\nour initial Business Combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a\\nloss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge\\nwith another business. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination, our public stockholders may receive only\\napproximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our public rights and public warrants will expire worthless.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa025\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\\nof 2002 will require substantial financial and management resources and may increase the time and costs of completing an initial\\nBusiness Combination.\\n\\xa0\\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,\\nor the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal control and may require that we have\\nsuch system of internal control audited. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control, we could be subject to regulatory\\nscrutiny, civil or criminal penalties and/or stockholder litigation. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports could\\nharm our business. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm report\\non management’s evaluation of our system of internal control, although as an “emerging growth company” as defined\\nin the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of an exemption to this requirement. A target company may not be in compliance with the\\nprovisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal control. The development of the internal control of any\\nsuch entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such initial\\nBusiness Combination. Furthermore, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the\\nimplementation of adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, could harm our operating results\\nor cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inferior internal control could also cause investors to lose confidence\\nin our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\\n\\xa0\\nWe are an emerging growth company within\\nthe meaning of the Securities Act, and certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies could\\nmake our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\\n\\xa0\\nThe JOBS Act permits “emerging growth\\ncompanies” like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public\\ncompanies that are not emerging growth companies. As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we intend to omit the auditor’s\\nattestation on internal control over financial reporting that would otherwise be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as described\\nabove. We also intend to take advantage of the exemption provided under the JOBS Act from the requirements to submit say-on-pay,\\nsay-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute votes to our stockholders and we will avail ourselves of reduced executive compensation\\ndisclosure that is already available to smaller reporting companies.\\n\\xa0\\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also\\nprovides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards\\nprovided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can\\ntherefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\\nWe have elected to take advantage of these benefits until we are no longer an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively\\nand irrevocably opt out of this exemption. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that\\ncomply with such new or revised accounting standards.\\n\\xa0\\nWe will continue to be an emerging growth company\\nuntil the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least\\n$1 billion (as indexed for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the\\nfirst public sale of Units, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion\\nin non-convertible debt, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” as defined under\\nthe Exchange Act.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa026\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nUntil such time that we lose “emerging\\ngrowth company” status, it is unclear if investors will find our securities less attractive because we may rely on these\\nexemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our\\nsecurities and our stock prices may be more volatile and could cause our stock prices to decline.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we effect our initial Business Combination\\nwith a company located outside of the United States, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact\\nour operations.\\n\\xa0\\nWe may effect our initial Business Combination\\nwith a company located outside of the United States. If we did, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated\\nwith companies operating in the target business’ home jurisdiction, including any of the following:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nrules and regulations or currency conversion or corporate withholding taxes on individuals;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\ntariffs and trade barriers;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nregulations related to customs and import/export matters;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nlonger payment cycles;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\ntax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\ncurrency fluctuations and exchange controls;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nchallenges in collecting accounts receivable;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\ncultural and language differences;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\nemployment regulations;\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\ncrime, strikes, riots, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks and wars; and\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n•\\ndeterioration of political relations with the United States.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWe may not be able to adequately address these\\nadditional risks. If we are unable to do so, our operations may suffer.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we effect our initial Business Combination\\nwith a target business located outside of the United States, the laws applicable to such target business will likely govern all\\nof our material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.\\n\\xa0\\nIf we effect our initial Business Combination\\nwith a target business located outside of the United States, the laws of the country in which such target business is domiciled\\nwill govern almost all of the material agreements relating to its operations. The target business may not be able to enforce any\\nof its material agreements in such jurisdiction and appropriate remedies to enforce its rights under such material agreements may\\nnot be available in this new jurisdiction. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not\\nbe as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any\\nof our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital. Additionally, if we\\nconsummate our initial Business Combination with a company located outside of the United States, it is likely that substantially\\nall of our assets would be located outside of the United States and some of our officers and directors might reside outside of\\nthe United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights, to effect\\nservice of process upon our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities\\nand criminal penalties of our directors and officers under Federal securities laws.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa027\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nProvisions in our amended and restated\\ncertificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might\\nbe willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.\\n\\xa0\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation\\ncontains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests.\\nThese provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and\\nissue new series of preferred shares, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that\\notherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. We are also subject to anti-takeover\\nprovisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult\\nthe removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market\\nprices for our securities.\\n\\xa0\\nBecause we must furnish our stockholders\\nwith target business financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or international\\nfinancial reporting standards, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial Business Combination with\\nsome prospective target businesses.\\n\\xa0\\nThe federal proxy rules require that a proxy\\nstatement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or\\npro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance\\nwith, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international\\nfinancial reporting standards, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required\\nto be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These\\nfinancial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may consummate our initial Business Combination\\nwith because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with\\nfederal proxy rules and complete our initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame.\\n\\xa0\\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a\\nfailure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\\n\\xa0\\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted\\nby national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements.\\nCompliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and\\nregulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material\\nadverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or\\nregulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa028\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n'"
